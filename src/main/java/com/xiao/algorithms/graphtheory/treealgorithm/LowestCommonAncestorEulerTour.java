/*
	The LCA of two nodes u and v in a rooted tree is the deepest node that has both u and v as descendants.
	It has several applications
	1. Finding distance between two nodes
	2. Inheritance hierarchies in OOP
	3. As a subroutine in several advanced algorithms and data structures
	Note that LCA of a node itself is the node LCA(12, 12) = 12
	LCA(10, LCA(12, 16)) = 2
